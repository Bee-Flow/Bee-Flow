 * Dutch for the automation builder strings that used to be hard-coded
 * English (2026-10): the Builder's panels, the step editors, the trigger
 * filters, the mapping pickers and the output views, plus the labels, hints
 * and placeholders of every field in them.
 *
 * The Dutch itself is in data/hardcoded-automation-builder-2026-10-nl.json.
 *
 * SAME_AS_ENGLISH lists the keys whose Dutch is the English text itself
 * (names, code, "true"/"false"). They are not seeded: the English default
 * already reads right, and a seeded copy would only hide a later rewording of
 * the English.
 *
 * Idempotent: only fills keys that are missing, so a workspace that curated
 * its own wording keeps it. Auto-runs from server boot
 * (boot/bootMigrations.js). Manual usage:
 *   node server/migrations/add-nl-hardcoded-automation-builder-2026-10-translations.js
