# S1 report: Automation Builder + Agents

- Branch: `ccr-c9112ca0-yggf5c`
- BASE: `81d6bedfc` (= `origin/ccr-28820270-xkvwp8` a3afd896 + `--no-ff` merge of `origin/ts-local/prep2`)
- Final commit: (updated on every push)

## Status
| Step | Package | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shared Builder modules (7 files) | drafting |
| 2 | Batch 22 + Builder sweep (batches 21-26) | waiting on step 1 |
| 3 | Batches 19, 20 | drafting |
| 4 | Long functions LF-A4, LF-A5, agents | pending |

## Scope notes
- `agents/AgentWizard/builderSplit/useKnowledgeBases.js` is 80 lines and has no function over 200 lines; the
  long-function entry is `hooks/useKnowledgeBases.ts` (LF-A9), outside S1's scope. Nothing to do there.
- `components/apps/appCatalog.jsx` (batch 21) is outside S1's scope (not under automation/).
